# E-CARGO-Codes
The codes are to solve related problems based on E-CARGO, Group Role Assignment with Constraints. 
All the problems have Java implementations, some of which need the CPLEX package. 
Due to the popularity of Python, I will provide Python codes for the GRA and GRA+ problems, these files ae named as Python_Pulp_*.txt. 
If you have any issues, please contact me by haibinz@nipissingu.ca
